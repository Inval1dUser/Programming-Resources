## Cheat Sheets/Guides/References
* [Codeacadamy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/arrays) 
* [The Trendy Coder](https://thetrendycoder.com/the-ultimate-c-cheat-sheet/)
* [How to Program in C++](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/how2cpp.20210603.html)
* [GeeksForGeeks C++ Cheat Sheet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) - I like this one the most
* [Quickref.me for C++](https://quickref.me/cpp) - This isn't the most in-depth resource out there, but it is a good quick reference cheat sheet. 
  * They also have a [Github page](https://github.com/Fechin/reference/blob/main/source/_posts/cpp.md)
* [Hacking C++](https://hackingcpp.com/tags/article.html) - Pretty good resource for infographics 
* [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) - 
* [CPlusPlus](https://cplusplus.com/)
* [Some Dudes C++ Notes](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/CPP) - I don't know who this guy is but his notes are awesome. Be sure to check them out.
* [Another C++ Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/mortennobel/cpp-cheatsheet)
* [Notes for Professionals](https://goalkicker.com/) - Pretty cool

## Websites/Learning Tools
  - [Learn C++ by Example](https://www.cbyexample.com/) 
  - [GeeksForGeeks - C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
    - This is the same website as stated previously, but I am putting it here again because it has a really good practice/learning tool
  - [HackerRank for C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
    - In my opinion, better for practicing than [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/), but it does not have any of the same reference resources.
  - [FreeCodeCamp 31+ Hour C++ Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o&t=8105s)
  - [Open Source Projects](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/filters?tags=c%2B%2B)


## Note
*Out of the Cheat Sheets/References and the Learning Tools, I would recommend using [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) for both purposes (as both a reference and practice tool).*

## Other Lists
*Please note that these lists are almost all for things other than learning, such as frameworks, libraries, engines, and other things of that nature*

  - [Awesome-Cheat-Sheets](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/more/free-programming-cheatsheets.md#cpp) - tbh I think this nullifies my whole list of cheatsheets here
  - [Awesome-C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) - I've noticed this one being the most linked-to list when asked about C++ resources
  - [Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects) - List of projects that anyone can do/solve - This could also go with the learning tools tbh.
  - [C++-Links](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks)
  - [Lefticus' C++ guide](https://lefticus.gitbooks.io/cpp-best-practices/content/02-Use_the_Tools_Available.html) - Similar to [Awesome-C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp)
  - [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-subjects.md) - list of programming guides, manuals, and other free books & resources
  - [Resources for Student Programmers](https://github.com/AchoArnold/discount-for-student-dev#readme) - Includes discounts and resources

#
#### I'm giving this it's own section because of it's sheer size and broad expanse of programming and development related topics

  - [AwesomeLists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - Resource Hub for Programming, Development, and Miscellaneous Topics
       - I don't know how useful this is for this specific class, but it's still worth poking around in.
